## Desktop Manga Reader

I wanted to have a good desktop manga reader for multiple reasons. mainly is to easily download chapters I want to read offline, I also wanted an app to keep track of where I left reading.

I'd like to precise that this is mainly for education purposes, I am learning a good amount of stuff from this project so I may not be perfect in my programming.
